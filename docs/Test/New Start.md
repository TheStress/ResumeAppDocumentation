## Motivation
- The general advice is that you should tailor make your resume for every application you apply for so that becomes a tedious process when applying for hundreds of jobs, so we are trying to streamline that process
- Our process for making a resume is starting with all of your experience you have ever done, with as much detail as you can place in it
- Then out of that main resume you select the relevant experience for a specific field
- Then for a specific application for a specific company you can tailor make the language to bypass the ATS systems
