## Format of this doc
- one part of my process of dealing and managing my resume
	- -> how I think we can design our app to do this part of the process 
## My Process -> Our App
- You should have a **main resume** with EVERYTHING you have EVER done that goes on a resume
	- ->To represent a **main resume** we decide to break your resume up into [[Block]](s), single bits of experiences, i.e. a single project, or single job
- Then as you apply to jobs you should narrow down parts of your resume that are relevant to that specific **field** and **company**.
	- -> To do this you can add the [[Block]](s) to a [[Resume]] for a specific **field** because only certain resume items are relevant to specific positions
	- -> You can also edit the [[Resume]] like a regular text editor (like google docs) because we also want the flexibility to tailor make your resume for a specific job application
	- -> Then when you have a resume you want to submit it should be easy to manage and store, (i.e. [[Source Control Side Panel]])
- Then generally the only times I edit my resume is either add a new item or edit an existing one, so the **main resume** with everything is a living doc that should always have the most up to date information
	- -> That is why the [[Block]](s) should sync across all [[Resume]](s) to keep them all up to date
