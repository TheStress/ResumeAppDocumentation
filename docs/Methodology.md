## The General Advice / Purpose
- You should have a **main resume** with EVERYTHING you have EVER done that goes on a resume
- Then as you apply to jobs you should narrow down parts of your resume that are relevant to that specific **field** and **company**.
## Our Method
- To represent a **main resume** we decide to break your resume up into [[Block]](s), single bits of experiences, i.e. a single project, or single job
- Then you narrow down the resume into a [[Field Resume]], made of [[Block]](s) relevant to the **field** you are applying for, i.e. "Game Developer Resume" or "Software Engineer Resume"
- Then you narrow down again into an [[Application Resume]], this is a copy of a [[Field Resume]] and the user edits based on the **company**, i.e." Game Developer at Blizzard", "Game Developer at Riot", or "Software Engineer at Google"
