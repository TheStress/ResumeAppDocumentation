## Purpose
- The user needs to narrow down their resume before specifically tailoring their resume so we allow users to create [[Field Resume]](s) based on blocks
- For the sake of time you can only add and remove [[Block]](s) in this editor
## Functionality
### Block Side Panel
- Has a side panel with all the blocks from the [[Block Editor]], where you can add blocks to current [[Field Resume]]

- When hovering over a block you can add it with a button press

### Removing Blocks
- in the editor you can just mouse over [[Block]](s) and remove them from the [[Field Resume]]

### Source Control Side Panel
- There is a side panel that allows you to navigate between the different [[Application Resume]](s) and previously copied [[Field Resume]](s)
- The (Current) [[Field Resume]] is the most recent one, the one that is synced with the [[Block]](s), and the one that shows up in the [[Resume Main Page]], and is the only one that can be edited

- When you navigate to an old field resume you can't edit anything and all you can do is use the source control panel

#### "Branching Off"
- For previous [[Field Resume]](s) branching off simply makes a copy of that [[Field Resume]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230427102116.png]]->![[Pasted image 20230427102406.png]]
- Clicking the branch off for the current [[Field Resume]] will save that version and make a copy of it
