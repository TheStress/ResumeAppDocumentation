## Purpose
- Since [[Block]](s) are supposed to represent ALL of your stuff on your resume the [[Block]](s) have their own editor
- This is meant to be the starting point when making your resumes, where you write down everything you've done and breaking them up into the [[Block]](s)
- Since we are generalizing as reusing blocks I assume there will be a lot of block so we need a search bar to help find blocks easier
## Functionality
- Create new block
- Edit existing blocks
- Delete existing blocks
### Search Bar
- search should be based on the content and tags
### Tags (not important right now, can be done later)
