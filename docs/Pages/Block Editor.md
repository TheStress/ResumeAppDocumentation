## Purpose
- Since [[Block]](s) are supposed to represent ALL of your stuff on your resume the [[Block]](s) have their own editor
- This is meant to be the starting point when making your resumes, where you write down everything you've done and breaking them up into the [[Block]](s)
- For the sake of time we have premade sections and formatting so the user just needs to input information into menus
## Functionality
- Any edits to [[Block]](s) sync with all [[Field Resume]](s) that have those blocks
### Example of a filled out Block Editor:
