## Purpose
- Since [[Block]](s) are supposed to represent ALL of your stuff on your resume the [[Block]](s) have their own editor
- This is meant to be the starting point when making your resumes, where you write down everything you've done and breaking them up into the [[Block]](s)
## Functionality
### Example of a filled out Block Editor:

### Adding New Blocks
- Allows you to add new [[Block]](s)
![[Pasted image 20230424111424.png]]
- This just creates a new [[Block]] in the current section and in there the user can write and style the text like a REGULAR text editor

### Editing a Block
- you can simply double click a block and you can start editing like a regular text editor
- Any edits made to a [[Block]] will propagate out to all of the [[Field Resume]](s) that contain that block
### Block Options
Note: I'm using a pre-written block and the menu comes up when the user selects the 3 dots

- Duplicating just duplicates the currently selected block with the same text and section
#### Selection
- The options menu starts off like this![[Pasted image 20230424113003.png]]
- Then when selecting the drop down you get all existing sections (each of them have 3 dots for more options) and an option to add a new section

- Delete is self explanitory but rename allows you to rename the section and changes it for all the existing blocks with that section

- When selecting add new section the user can type here and add new section
