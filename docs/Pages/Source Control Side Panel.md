## Purpose
- We need the users to make copies and track their resumes so we provide the panel on the side for easy access
## Functionality
- There is a side panel that allows you to navigate between the different [[Application Resume]](s) and previously copied [[Field Resume]](s)
- The (Current) [[Field Resume]] is the most recent one, the one that is synced with the [[Block]](s), and the one that shows up in the [[Resume Main Page]], and is the only one that can be edited

- When you navigate to an old field resume you can't edit anything and all you can do is use the source control panel

#### "Branching Off"
- For previous [[Field Resume]](s) branching off simply makes a copy of that [[Field Resume]]

- Clicking the branch off for the current [[Field Resume]] will save that version and make a copy of it
