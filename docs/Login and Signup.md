# Purpose
- People want to save and access their resumes later so they need accounts to login (for returning users) and sign up (for new users).
- for returning users I am assuming they wanna edit a resume for an application so we send them to the [[Resume Main Page]] right after logging in
- for new users they need to fill out our system with their resume information so we send them to [[Block Editor]] right after signing up
# Functionality
- login email and password
- sign up using username, email, and password
- after logging in send to [[Resume Main Page]]
- or signing up send to [[Block Editor]]
